# Contributing to telescope-cmdline.nvim

Thanks for considering to contribute.

## Getting started

If you're not sure where to help? You can try these:

- You can look at the currently open
  [issues](https://github.com/jonarrien/telescope-cmdline.nvim/issues)
  to see if some bug needs fixing or for cool feature ideas.<br>
  You should also look at currently open PRs ([Pull requests](https://github.com/jonarrien/telescope-cmdline.nvim/pulls)) to see if some abandoned PR interests you.<br>
  *We could really use some help with tests & docs they are currently lacking :)*

Good luck!
